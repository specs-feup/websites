        <h2>Tutorial: The ANTAREX Approach to Adaptively Optimize and Enforce Extra-Functional Properties on HPC Applications</h2>
        <h3>Date: Nov. 3, 2018</h3>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Developing and optimizing applications for energy-efficient HPC systems up to the Exascale era is an extremely challenging problem. They are complex tasks that require mastering several programming languages and tools for performance tuning, which is incompatible with the trend to open HPC infrastructures to a wider range of users. The support of standard languages and APIs is crucial to provide migration paths towards novel heterogeneous HPC platforms as well as to guarantee the ability of developers to work effectively on these platforms. In this tutorial we show how the ANTAREX DSL-based approach allows developers to program and apply strategies (recipes) to applications in the context of extra-functional requirements, such as performance and energy-efficiency. We show our holistic and versatile approach spanning various decision layers composing the supercomputer software stack and exploiting effectively the system capabilities, including heterogeneity and energy management. Specifically, we present the ANTAREX toolflow to enable the definition of energy-efficiency, performance, and adaptivity strategies as well as their enforcement at runtime through application autotuning and resource and power management. Through representative case studies and a hands-on-approach, we show how the ANTAREX toolflow can effectively assist various development/optimization stages, including application analysis and profiling, code transformations and parallelization, and integration of monitoring and runtime autotuning.

        <h1>Main Topics</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overview of the ANTAREX Approach</strong>: In this time slot we will introduce the ANTAREX goals, its main approach and the main tools developed to achieve those goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring and Control</strong>: the ExaMon and Countdown approach: We will introduce the scalable and flexible ExaMon monitoring framework and the Countdown power management library. We will start by describing the problem of large scale cluster monitoring and energy & power optimization of supercomputing machines. We will then describe our ExaMon framework and how this can lead to automated mechanism to manage the datacenter. Finally we present Countdown and explain how you can use it to reduce the energy footprint of your MPI applications in production without paying execution time overheads.</li>
            <li><strong>Runtime Autotuning</strong>: the mARGOt approach: We will introduce runtime autotuning and will present the mARGOt approach for runtime autotuning. We will describe how to use mARGOt in a software application, including the creation of a knowledge database, the kind of application and optimization knobs that can be used, the autotuning schemes and the approaches for searching the space and for dealing with multiple goals.</li>
            <li><strong>DSL and Source to Source Compilation</strong>: We will start by presenting the main DSL and compiler features provided by Clava+LARA. We will follow a hands-on-approach and the use of simple, but representative, examples to show how the compiler is able to transform code, to automatically parallelize C/C++ code using OpenMP directives, to expose software and optimization knobs for autotuning, and to integrate other tools and APIs (e.g., the ExaMon API and the mARGOt autotuner).</li>
            <li><strong>Main ANTAREX achievements</strong>: We will present the main achievements of the ANTAREX approach and toolflow support considering the two ANTAREX industrial use cases requiring HPC: (1) a biopharmaceutical application for drug discovery; and (2) a self-adaptive navigation system for smart cities.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The exercises will be based on an example application that is relatively simple and known to the audience (e.g., matrix multiplication). We will use the LARA DSL and the Clava source to source compiler to apply increasingly more complex strategies over this initial example, starting with simple instrumentation strategies for measuring performance and energy, to performing design-space exploration and finally control the application with an autotuner.
        </p>

        <p>We will show through a hands-on-approach how the tools and APIs provided by ANTAREX are able to efficiently and effectively help users/developers and how they can complement traditional tool flows.</p>
