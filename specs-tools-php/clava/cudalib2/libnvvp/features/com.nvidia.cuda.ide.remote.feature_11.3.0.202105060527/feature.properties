1. NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit License Agreement\n\
----------------------------------------\n\
\n\
\n\
Important Notice\n\
----------------\n\
\n\
READ CAREFULLY: This Software License Agreement ("Agreement")\n\
for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, including computer software and\n\
associated documentation ("Software"), is the Agreement which\n\
governs use of the SOFTWARE of NVIDIA Corporation and its\n\
subsidiaries ("NVIDIA") downloadable herefrom. By downloading,\n\
installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, You (as\n\
defined below) agree to be bound by the terms of this\n\
Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement,\n\
do not download the SOFTWARE.\n\
\n\
\n\
Recitals\n\
--------\n\
\n\
Use of NVIDIA's SOFTWARE requires three elements: the\n\
SOFTWARE, an NVIDIA GPU or application processor ("NVIDIA\n\
Hardware"), and a computer system. The SOFTWARE is protected\n\
by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as\n\
well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The\n\
SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for Your\n\
use, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The NVIDIA\n\
Hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but\n\
this Agreement does not cover the sale or use of such\n\
hardware, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package\n\
with the SOFTWARE. This Agreement sets forth the terms and\n\
conditions of the SOFTWARE only.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.1. Definitions\n\
\n\
\n\
1.1.1. Licensee\n\
\n\
"You", or "Your" shall mean the entity or individual that\n\
downloads and uses the SOFTWARE.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.1.2. Redistributable Software\n\
\n\
"Redistributable Software" shall mean the redistributable\n\
libraries referenced in Attachment A of this Agreement.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.1.3. Software\n\
\n\
"SOFTWARE" shall mean the deliverables provided pursuant to\n\
this Agreement. SOFTWARE may be provided in either source or\n\
binary form, at NVIDIA's discretion.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.2. Grant of License\n\
\n\
\n\
1.2.1. Rights and Limitations of Grant\n\
\n\
Provided that Licensee complies with the terms of this\n\
Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants Licensee the following\n\
limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable\n\
(except as expressly permitted otherwise for Redistributable\n\
Software in Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3 of this\n\
Agreement) right to use the SOFTWARE -- and, if the SOFTWARE\n\
is provided in source form, to compile the SOFTWARE -- with\n\
the following limitations:\n\
\n\
\n\
1.2.1.1. Redistribution Rights\n\
\n\
Licensee may transfer, redistribute, and sublicense certain\n\
files of the Redistributable SOFTWARE, as defined in\n\
Attachment A of this Agreement, provided, however, that (a)\n\
the Redistributable SOFTWARE shall be distributed solely in\n\
binary form to Licensee's licensees ("Customers") only as a\n\
component of Licensee's own software products (each, a\n\
"Licensee Application"); (b) Licensee shall design the\n\
Licensee Application such that the Redistributable SOFTWARE\n\
files are installed only in a private (non-shared) directory\n\
location that is used only by the Licensee Application; (c)\n\
Licensee shall obtain each Customer's written or clickwrap\n\
agreement to the license terms under a written, legally\n\
enforceable agreement that has the effect of protecting the\n\
SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less\n\
restrictive than this Agreement.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.2.1.2. Usage Rights\n\
\n\
Licensee may install and use multiple copies of the SOFTWARE\n\
on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,\n\
and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for\n\
Licensee's use within Licensee's Enterprise. "Enterprise"\n\
shall mean individual use by Licensee or any legal entity\n\
(such as a corporation or university) and the subsidiaries it\n\
owns by more than 50 percent.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.2.1.3. Further Redistribution Rights\n\
\n\
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Licensee\n\
may authorize Customers to further redistribute the\n\
Redistributable SOFTWARE that such Customers receive as part\n\
of the Licensee Application, solely in binary form, provided,\n\
however, that Licensee shall require in their standard\n\
software license agreements with Customers that all such\n\
redistributions must be made pursuant to a license agreement\n\
that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights\n\
of NVIDIA whose terms and conditions are at least as\n\
restrictive as those in the applicable Licensee software\n\
license agreement covering the Licensee Application. For\n\
avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement shall not\n\
affect rights previously granted by Licensee to its Customers\n\
under this Agreement to the extent validly granted to\n\
Customers under Section 1.2.1.1.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.2.1.4. Linux/FreeBSD Exception\n\
\n\
Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 1.2.1.2,\n\
Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3, SOFTWARE designed\n\
exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating systems,\n\
or other operating systems derived from the source code to\n\
these operating systems, may be copied and redistributed,\n\
provided that the binary files thereof are not modified in any\n\
way (except for unzipping of compressed files).\n\
\n\
\n\
1.2.1.5. Additional Licensing Obligations\n\
\n\
Licensee acknowledges and agrees that its use of certain third\n\
party components included with the SOFTWARE may be subject to\n\
additional licensing terms and conditions as set forth or\n\
referenced in Attachment B of this Agreement.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.2.1.6. Limitations\n\
\n\
No Reverse Engineering\n\
\n\
If the SOFTWARE is provided in binary form, Licensee may not\n\
reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor\n\
attempt in any other manner to obtain the source code.\n\
\n\
No Separation of Components\n\
\n\
The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product. Except as\n\
authorized in this Agreement, Software component parts of the\n\
Software may not be separated for use on more than one\n\
computer, nor otherwise used separately from the other parts.\n\
\n\
No Rental\n\
\n\
Licensee may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone else.\n\
\n\
No Modifications\n\
\n\
If the SOFTWARE is provided in source form, Licensee may not\n\
modify or create derivative works of the SOFTWARE.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.3. Term and Termination\n\
\n\
This Agreement will continue in effect for two (2) years\n\
("Initial Term") after Your initial download and use of the\n\
SOFTWARE, subject to the exclusive right of NVIDIA to\n\
terminate as provided herein. The term of this Agreement will\n\
automatically renew for successive one (1) year renewal terms\n\
after the Initial Term, unless either party provides to the\n\
other party at least three (3) months prior written notice of\n\
termination before the end of the applicable renewal term.\n\
\n\
This Agreement will automatically terminate if Licensee fails\n\
to comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof. In such\n\
event, Licensee must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and\n\
all of its component parts.\n\
\n\
\n\
Defensive Suspension\n\
\n\
If Licensee commences or participates in any legal proceeding\n\
against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion,\n\
suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights\n\
provided under this Agreement during the pendency of such\n\
legal proceedings.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.4. Copyright\n\
\n\
All rights, title, interest and copyrights in and to the\n\
SOFTWARE (including but not limited to all images,\n\
photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and other\n\
information incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the accompanying\n\
printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned\n\
by NVIDIA, or its suppliers. The SOFTWARE is protected by\n\
copyright laws and international treaty provisions.\n\
Accordingly, Licensee is required to treat the SOFTWARE like\n\
any other copyrighted material, except as otherwise allowed\n\
pursuant to this Agreement and that it may make one copy of\n\
the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archive purposes.\n\

experience, talent, and/or expertise. NVIDIA shall not have\n\
any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such\n\
employees, agents or contractors or to pay royalties for any\n\
work resulting from the use of Residuals.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.7.1.3. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\
\n\
FEEDBACK FROM EITHER PARTY IS PROVIDED FOR THE OTHER PARTY'S\n\
USE "AS IS" AND BOTH PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS,\n\
IMPLIED AND STATUTORY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE\n\
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\n\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. BOTH PARTIES DO NOT\n\
REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE FEEDBACK WILL MEET THE OTHER\n\
PARTY'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OR IMPLEMENTATION\n\
OF THE FEEDBACK WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.7.1.4. No Liability for Consequential Damages\n\
\n\
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT\n\
SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,\n\
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER\n\
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS\n\
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,\n\
OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR\n\
INABILITY TO USE THE FEEDBACK, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS\n\
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.7.2. Freedom of Action\n\
\n\
Licensee agrees that this Agreement is nonexclusive and NVIDIA\n\
may currently or in the future be developing software, other\n\
technology or confidential information internally, or\n\
receiving confidential information from other parties that\n\
maybe similar to the Feedback and Licensee's confidential\n\
information (as provided in Section 1.7.1.2 above), which may\n\
be provided to NVIDIA in connection with Feedback by Licensee.\n\
Accordingly, Licensee agrees that nothing in this Agreement\n\
will be construed as a representation or inference that NVIDIA\n\
will not develop, design, manufacture, acquire, market\n\
products, or have products developed, designed, manufactured,\n\
acquired, or marketed for NVIDIA, that compete with the\n\
Licensee's products or confidential information.\n\
\n\
\n\

\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with, or\n\
cannot be fully enforced under, the law, such provision will\n\
be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be\n\
consistent with and fully enforceable under the law. This\n\
Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement\n\
between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and\n\
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and\n\
agreements relating to such subject matter, whether oral or\n\
written. This Agreement may only be modified in writing signed\n\
by an authorized officer of NVIDIA. Licensee agrees that it\n\
will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any\n\

United States Bureau of Industry and Security or any export\n\
laws, restrictions or regulations.\n\
\n\
\n\
1.7.5. \n\
\n\
The parties agree that the following sections of the Agreement\n\
will survive the termination of the License: Section 1.2.1.4,\n\

    PCRE LICENCE\n\
    ------------\n\
    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax\n\
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.\n\
    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as\n\
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc" \n\
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The\n\
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also \n\
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-\n\
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are \n\
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.\n\

personal computer. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws\n\
and international copyright treaties, as well as other\n\
intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is not\n\
sold, and instead is only licensed for use, strictly in\n\
accordance with this document. The hardware is protected by\n\
various patents, and is sold, but this agreement does not\n\
cover that sale, since it may not necessarily be sold as a\n\
package with the SOFTWARE. This agreement sets forth the terms\n\
and conditions of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.\n\
\n\
\n\
4.1. DEFINITIONS\n\
\n\

Customer's use within Customer's Enterprise. "Enterprise"\n\
shall mean individual use by Customer or any legal entity\n\
(such as a corporation or university) and the subsidiaries it\n\
owns by more than fifty percent (50%).\n\
\n\
\n\
4.2.1.2. Linux/FreeBSD Exception\n\
\n\
Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 4.2.1.1,\n\
SOFTWARE designed exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD\n\
operating systems, or other operating systems derived from the\n\
source code to these operating systems, may be copied and\n\
redistributed, provided that the binary files thereof are not\n\
modified in any way (except for unzipping of compressed\n\
files).\n\
\n\
\n\
4.2.1.3. Limitations\n\
\n\
No Reverse Engineering\n\
\n\
Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble\n\
the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the\n\
source code.\n\
\n\
No Separation of Components\n\
\n\
The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product. Its component\n\
parts may not be separated for use on more than one computer,\n\
nor otherwise used separately from the other parts.\n\
\n\
No Rental\n\
\n\
Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone else.\n\
\n\
\n\

comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof. In such\n\
event, Customer must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and\n\
all of its component parts.\n\
\n\
Defensive Suspension. If Customer commences or participates in\n\
any legal proceeding against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its\n\
sole discretion, suspend or terminate all license grants and\n\
any other rights provided under this LICENSE during the\n\
pendency of such legal proceedings.\n\
\n\
\n\
4.4. COPYRIGHT\n\
\n\
All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but\n\
not limited to all images, photographs, animations, video,\n\
audio, music, text, and other information incorporated into\n\
the SOFTWARE), the accompanying printed materials, and any\n\
copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned by NVIDIA, or its suppliers.\n\
The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international\n\
treaty provisions. Accordingly, Customer is required to treat\n\
the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted material, except as\n\
otherwise allowed pursuant to this LICENSE and that it may\n\
make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archive\n\
purposes.\n\
\n\

(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS\n\
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,\n\
OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR\n\
INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED\n\
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
\n\
4.7. MISCELLANEOUS\n\
\n\
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n\
International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed. If any\n\
provision of this LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be\n\
fully enforced under, the law, such provision will be\n\
construed as limited to the extent necessary to be consistent\n\
with and fully enforceable under the law. This agreement is\n\
the final, complete and exclusive agreement between the\n\
parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes\n\
all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements\n\
relating to such subject matter, whether oral or written.\n\
Customer agrees that it will not ship, transfer or export the\n\
SOFTWARE into any country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner,\n\
prohibited by the United States Bureau of Export\n\
Administration or any export laws, restrictions or\n\
regulations. This LICENSE may only be modified in writing\n\
signed by an authorized officer of NVIDIA.\n\

intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement\n\
will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement has\n\
been negotiated by the parties and their respective counsel\n\
